Multi Linear Regression
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Multiple Linear Regression model using Python. Multiple Linear Regression is a statistical technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Wizbik27/Multi-Lenear-Regression
cd multi-linear-regression
Prepare the dataset:

Place your dataset in the data/ directory. Ensure the dataset is in CSV format and includes both dependent and independent variables.

Data
Ensure your dataset is a CSV file with appropriate column headers. The dependent variable (target) should be clearly labeled. The data preprocessing script will handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

Model
The model.py script builds and trains a Multiple Linear Regression model using the Scikit-learn library. It performs the following steps:

Loads the dataset.
Preprocesses the data.
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Trains the model on the training set.
Saves the trained model.
Evaluation
The evaluation.py script evaluates the model's performance using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score. It also provides visualizations of the model's predictions compared to the actual values.
